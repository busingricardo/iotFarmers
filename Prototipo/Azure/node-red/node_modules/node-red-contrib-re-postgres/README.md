## node-red-contrib-re-postgres

A [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) node to query [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)  based on original node by Kris Daniels.
This node clearly replaces original node to be compatible with latest Node-red versions.

### Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install node-red-contrib-re-postgres

 The node-red postgres node uses a template node to set the query and uses msg.queryParameters as params for the query.  
 Each property in msg.queryParameters can be used as $propertyName in the query, see the 'setup params' and 'format query' node in the example.  
 The msg it then passed to the postgres node.  
 If you want the output of the query, check the 'Receive output' box in the postgres node.  
 If you want the output of the query been sent by row, check the 'One message per row' box in the postgres node.  
 The result of the query is then set on the msg.payload property which can be sent to a http node.

### Changes

 - Added status for currently running queries count
 - Added limiter for simultaneous queries (with option to enqueue or drop new messages and option to drop new message if it is already enqueued)
 - Added limiter for similar queries (with option of how to separate queries, option to enqueue or drop new messages and option to drop new message if it is already enqueued)
