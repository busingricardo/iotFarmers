Security module used to provide X509 authentication capabilities to the Azure IoT Hub device client and Azure IoT Hub Provisioning Service device client.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/azure-iot-security-x509.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/azure-iot-security-x509)

## Install

There are at least 3 different packages involved when writing code to take advantage of the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service:
- The "client" package that will be used to create a provisioning client. This is the **azure-iot-provisioning-device** package.
- the "transport" package that will decide which protocol will be used to communicate with the provisioning service. One of **azure-iot-provisioning-device-amqp**, **azure-iot-provisioning-device-mqtt**, or **azure-iot-provisioning-device-http**. Please note that X509 authentication is supported with all protocols but TPM authentication is supported only with AMQP and HTTP.
- The "security client" package that will be used to interface with whatever type of security (x509 or TPM) is used to authenticate the device. This package (**azure-iot-security-x509**) provides x509 authentication capabilities.

For example:
```
npm install --save azure-iot-provisioning-device
npm install --save azure-iot-provisioning-device-amqp # Or -mqtt or -http
npm install --save azure-iot-security-x509 # Or -tpm
```
